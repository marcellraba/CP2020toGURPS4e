Assuming normal distribution about 1 in every 2 million people will possess an attribute of 15 (about 3 people in Night City) and 16 is about 1 in 500 million (15-20 people on Earth), 17 would be 1 in 390 billion (probably noone in the history of the entire of the human race). People who don’t possess that unusual background cannot go over 14 naturally. You can go over this limit with cybernetics."

					"text": "OPTIONAL!!! (but part of the setting)\n\nCyberpsychosis is based off corruption found in GURPS Horror page 146.\n\n\"The GM keeps track of each PC’s Corruption total in secret, and is encouraged to lie like a\ndemon when asked for a current total: “No, you feel fine. Better than fine! Your moral clarity is unimpaired.” Every week, anyone with even a point of Corruption must roll against Will at -1 per full 10 points of Corruption. Failure converts Corruption to negative character points, at -1 point per full 25 points of Corruption. The GM may use these points to lower self-control rolls for “evil” disad- vantages like Sadism or Bloodlust, chip away at “good” disadvantages like Honesty or Pacifism, impose penalties on Reputation or influence rolls with good or pure individuals, impose penalties on Fright Checks or\nWill rolls, add quirks, cause afflictions, or add full-on disadvantages from Berserk, Paranoia, Meglomania, Fanaticism (Cybernetic), Delusions, The Flesh is Weak, Bloodlust, Sadism. Once someone has 125+ points of Corruption, the GM may convert it into negative character points regardless of the Will roll. Then again, the GM might allow the\nCorruption to build up until one final blowout, even if the player fails his roll!\"\n\nWays to acquire corruption points:\nGetting new cyber, corruption points gained depend on the difficulty of surgery and the character points gained.\nNegligible surgery adds 1 corruption point\nMinor surgery adds 1d corruption points\nMajor surgery adds 2d corruption points\nCritical surgery adds 3d corruption points\nYou also add the character points gained to the total, if you'd lose points treat it as 0 points. The final gain cannot be lower than 1 corruption point.\n\nGetting surgery done in a Swedish or Orbital hospital halves the corruption gain (round up), regular hospitals are at a ×1, other clinics at a ×1.5 and if installed in very rough conditions with rudimentary equipment it's a ×2.\n\nOptionally: Combat cyberware is at 1.5× corruption gain.\n\nBelow are some more optional options to gain corruption:\nDo hard drugs, depending on the drug anywhere from 1 point to 2d corruption\nLiving in really bad conditions 1 point per week.\nFailing self control rolls on disadvantages that hurt people 1 to 1d points.\nHanging out with people near the edge 1d-2 (minimum 1) per day.\n\nVery optionally you can penalize cybernetics use and reckless behaviour:\n\nKill people using your cybernetics 1d corruption\nKill people the regular way 1d-2 corruption (minimum 1)\nSolve tasks with your cybernetics 1d-3 corruption (minimum 1)\n\nYou can shed corruption undergoing therapy, the therapist has to possess Psychology 12+ for this to work, on a success see the corruption loss below, on a critical success you lose 1.5× as much, on a failure nothing happens that week, on a critical failure gain that many corruption points.\nOutpatient (8 hours a week) 500 eb/week, you lose 1d/2 corruption per week\nOutpatient (14 hours a week) 1000 eb/week, you lose 1d corruption per week\nInpatient (168 hours a week) 5000 eb/week, you lose 2d+2 corruption per week\nICT (168 hours a week) 10 000 eb/week, you lose 4d corruption per week.\nYou also naturally lose corruption at the rate of 1 per week where you didn't gain more than 1 point of corruption.\n\nOnce a character has acquired -40 points in disadvantages from Berserk, Paranoia, Megalomania, Fanaticism (Cybernetics, Extreme), Delusions (The Flesh is Weak, Severe), Bloodlust and Sadism he is considered a cyberpsycho at which point they automatically become an NPC."
